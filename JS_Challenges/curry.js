Curry

Write a curry function that takes in a required callback function and returns a curried version of that function. This callback function can take in any number of arguments, including none at all.

If the curried function is called with arguments, it should return a new function, which can be called with more arguments, to be passed to the underlying callback.

If the curried function (or one of the returned new functions) is called with no arguments, this should be considered the end of the curried function calls, and the callback should be called with every argument that was passed, in the correct order.

For simplicity, you don't need to worry about binding a this context (i.e., you can assume that the callback doesn't reference this).

If you're unfamiliar with currying and are confused by this prompt, we recommend watching the Currying video of the JavaScript Crash Course before starting to code.

Sample Usage
const sum = (...numbers) => numbers.reduce((total, number) => total + number, 0);
const curriedSum = curry(sum);

curriedSum(); // 0
curriedSum(1)(); // 1
curriedSum(1)(2)(); // 3
curriedSum(1, 2)(3)(4, 5, 6)(); // 21
curriedSum(1); // [Function]
curriedSum(1, 2)(3); // [Function]
*/

function curry(callback) {
  // Write your code here.
  function curried(...args) {
    if (args.length === 0) {
      return callback();
    }

    return function (...nextArgs) {
      if (nextArgs.length === 0) {
        return callback(...args);
      }

      return curried(...args, ...nextArgs);
    };
  }

  return curried;
}
